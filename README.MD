# Expo React Native example written in excellent [squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint)

## Quick start

- Install dependencies:

  ``` bash
  $ npm i
  ```

- Run `bb dev` to start expo dev server and squint watcher to hot-reload yor project

## About

Universal app that runs on Android, iOS and the web using Expo

This is a fully functional clone of the official tutorial from the Expo website ([tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/))

## Steps to reproduce by yourself

If you want to setup project from scratch:

- Initialize a new Expo app 

  ``` bash
  $ npx create-expo-app expo-react-native
  ```

- Create a `squint.edn` to specify the source directories, output directory for compiled
  js-files and to use the `.jsx` extension for outputted files

  See [squint.edn](squint.edn)
  
- Change the contents of the App.js file to:

  ``` js
  import App from './out-js/App';
  export default App;
  ```

 â€‹This is necessary so that the expo can see your app entry point.

- Run expo dev server

  ``` bash
  $ npx expo start
  ```

- Run squin watcher

  ``` bash
  $ npx squint watch
  ```
